# GasShare

**GasShare** is a collaborative ride-sharing cost management app that allows users to easily share the costs of a trip based on mileage and vehicle information. Users can create an account, input their destination, and list drivers. The app automatically calculates the trip's cost based on the mileage and the make and model of the car. Once the trip is completed, GasShare splits the cost amongst all drivers and enables users to send Venmo or PayPal requests directly within the app, simplifying the process of sharing travel expenses.

## Key Features:

- **Account Creation**: Register and manage your GasShare profile.
